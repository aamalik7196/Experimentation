  ##### 1. Iris Dataset experimentation.ipynb
           Objective : 
           Building a basic machine learning model using K - Nearest Neighbours to predict 
           type of iris flower. Perform data exploration using various basic visualizations.
          
  ##### 2. NER.ipynb
          Objective : 
          Gained an understanding of spaCy package's capabilities by analysing books listed in the 
          Gutenberg Project to observe Ziphy's law in natural language processing.
          Leveraging spaCy's named entity recognition for finding collocations and associations between
          words from a text corpus; built using more than ten thousand newspaper articles. Used these 
          associations to successfully map organization names to member countries.
          
  ##### 3. DSBD Project1.ipynb
          Objective : 
          Experimented with data visualization techniques in Tableau as an exercise in understanding effective 
          communication strategies for presenting complex data sets and insights to business users.
          Providing compelling insights into factors that contributed positively and negatively towards the 
          happiness index of countries.

  ##### 4 DSBD Project2.ipynb
          Objective:
          Employed clustering techniques on NCAA basketball player statistics to successfully cluster and identify 
          players in the traditional five positions on the court. Used silhouette metrics and outlier detection to 
          dentify athletes with cross-positional contribution capabilities to aid scout talent discovery
