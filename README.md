  ##### 1. Iris Dataset experimentation.ipynb
        Objective : Building a basic machine learning model using K - Nearest Neighbours to predict 
                    type of iris flower. 
                    Perform data exploration using various basic visualizations.
 
          
  ##### 2. NER.ipynb
          Objective : 
          1. Gaining an understanding of spaCy package's capabilities by analyzing books 
          listed in the Gutenburgh Project to observe Ziphy's law in natural language processing.
          2. Leveraging spaCy's named entity recognition to identify entities from more 
          than ten thousand newspaper articles  with the objective of calculating Pointwise Mutual Information.
          3. PMI was used to determine association between recognized entities.
          
 ##### 3. DSBD Project1.ipynb
          Experimented with data visualization techniques in Tableau as an exercise in understanding effective 
          communication strategies for presenting complex data sets and insights to business users.
          Providing compelling insights into factors that contributed positively and negatively towards the 
          happiness index of countries.

 ##### 4 DSBD Project2.ipynb
        Objective:
        Employed clustering techniques on NCAA basketball player statistics to successfully cluster and identify 
        players in the traditional five positions on the court. Used silhouette metrics and outlier detection to 
        dentify athletes with cross-positional contribution capabilities to aid scout talent discovery
